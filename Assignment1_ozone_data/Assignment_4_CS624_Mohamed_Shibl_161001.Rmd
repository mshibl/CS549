## Obtaining R_Squared
Running a multiple linear regression example with a model where Y = Ozone, X1 = Temp, X2 = Wind.
This equation will provide us with the value of R_squared.

In this case R_squared is equal 0.5814. Which is a relatively low value meaning that knowing the value of wind and tempreature does not provide us with a certain value of ozone.

```{r}
# sets the working directory
setwd("/Users/Shibl/Google Drive/Herguan University/2016 Fall/CS549 - Big Data Analytics/Assignment 1")
# Reads the data into R 
mydata<-read.csv("Ozone_data.csv")
# Runs a Regression model and gives the summary output
summary(lm(Ozone ~ Temp+Wind, data = mydata))
```
